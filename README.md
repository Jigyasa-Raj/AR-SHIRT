### Notes
- Use Windows or Mac to export and build your project.  
  
- Emulator support is limited and requires special setup. Please use a physical device for Android and iOS.
- Supports Unity 2019.4.3 or later, we recommend the latest LTS.
- Use only OpenGLES3 as Graphics API on Android for AR compatibility.


## Notice
Need me to respond, tag me [HoodBoyPK](https://github.com/hoodboypk). 

This plugin expects you to atleast know how to use Unity Engine. If you have issues with how unity widget is presented, you can please modify your unity project build settings as you seem fit.

Moving forward, versioning of the package will change to match unity releases after proper test. Mind you this does not mean the package
is not compatible with other versions, it just mean it's been tested to work with a unity version.

Windows coming soon.
